                <p class=middle> With the wireframe prototype, I had three in-person or remote usability tests. Each user had four tasks that they needed to complete.

<br><br>Task 1: Sign up for an account
<br>Task 2: Creating a new piece of content
<br>Task 3: Share content
<br>Task 4: Create a new reminder

<br><br>The participants were able to complete each of the steps. When users were asked to create a new document, they initally looked near the documents section. Users did find the create button but going forward I knew the documents and folders sections should have a new option.

              <p class="left-side ">The next step before creating the layout of Fruitful, was establishing the look and feel of the brand. This included choosing Permanent Marker as the brand font becuase it portrays the idea of writing a to-do list. Next, I chose Raleway as the type font becuase it is clean, simple and modern to counteract the permanent market. Raleway is very versatile and includes many different font weights.
I chose orange as the brand color becuase of its association with productivity. Orange is a combination of the energy of yellow and intensity of red. I want users to feel productive, energized and have an intensity for their work when using Fruitful.

                <div class=conclusion>
                  <p><br>Overall, I think the project was a success. I worked with users to discover that they were looking for a platform that made staying organized and increasing their productivity easier. Every decision I made for the project was based on making things easier for the user so they can be more productive.

<br><br>One thing that did not go well was I started out wanting the platform to include too many features. I had to make decisions to cut things so that the product was manageable. For example I wanted the platform to turn calendar items into to do list items but I decided to have the program create reminders instead.

<br><br>Going into the project I doubted that I would be able to find an available market but I was able to find the productivity market and dig into that more.

<br><br>I learned how much of an impact the user survey has on the project. It is really important to have the right questions and get enough responses. I was able to discover the productivity market through my survey and which features I should be focusing on.

<br><br>If I had more time I would like to make the platform more intuitive. One feature I was able to make more intuitive was including the recent changes on the dashboard. This makes it easy for users to know whether the document they are waiting for someone else to do their part on, has been updated or not without having to constantly check it. Something I would add going forward would be the option to set a notification that allows users to be notified when the document is edited.
